/*
 * Milepost top-level state machine.
 *
 *   BOOT
 *     │
 *     ▼
 *   WIFI_SETUP       → PageWifiSetup    (scan + password panel)
 *     │
 *     ▼
 *   WIFI_CONNECTING  → PageWifiConnecting
 *     │
 *     ▼
 *   READY            → PageHome (or last-seen page)
 *
 * A boot with saved WiFi creds skips straight from BOOT to WIFI_CONNECTING.
 * Reset Connection (Settings page) wipes the saved SSID/password from NVS
 * and re-enters WIFI_SETUP.
 *
 * WiFi on Milepost exists purely to serve OTA (see main/ota.c) — live
 * data comes from CAN, so no data-plane state is tied to the WiFi link.
