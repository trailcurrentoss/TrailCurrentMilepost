/*
 * perf.c — LVGL task stall detector + keyboard mode-switch profiler.
 *
 * Two lightweight probes, both intended for on-device diagnosis of the
 * "keyboard mode switch takes forever" complaint on the wizard pages.
 *
 * 1. Stall watchdog — an lv_timer that fires every 100 ms. Because
 *    lv_timers run on the LVGL task, a stalled task can't fire them on
 *    time. When the delta between fires exceeds 200 ms we log the actual
 *    duration; that number is a direct measurement of how long the LVGL
 *    task was blocked on something (a slow render, a long callback, a
 *    lock contention, etc.).
 *
 * 2. Keyboard VALUE_CHANGED probe — hooks LV_EVENT_VALUE_CHANGED on each
 *    of the three keyboards and logs each event with a monotonic
 *    timestamp. Correlate with the very-next "LVGL task stalled" line to
 *    see how long the mode-switch render took: a stall right after a kb
 *    event = the mode switch was what blocked the task.
 *
 * Compile-guarded on ui/screens.h so the file collapses when the export
 * hasn't run yet.

     * more than 10 px is classified as a scroll gesture instead of a
     * click, and no CLICKED event fires on the keyboard button under
     * the finger. User sees "I tapped the key, nothing happened,
     * tapped again." The DOWN/UP pair is present in the touch log —
     * LVGL just refused to convert it into a click.

     * of drift tolerance — matches iPhone/Android-class forgiveness.
     * LVGL's PRESS_LOCK guarantees the CLICKED event still fires on the

     * onto) so this doesn't cause wrong-key registrations. Genuine
     * scroll gestures typically travel 200+ px in a single direction so
